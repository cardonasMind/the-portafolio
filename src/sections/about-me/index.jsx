            <p>I am a 17.6-year-old teenager, almost of being 18 years old (of course). In general, I consider myself someone with a lot of potential to do whatever I want. I am a born leader and I enjoy learning and I am very imaginative, so much so that sometimes I go too far from "reality".</p>
            
            <p>I think my gift goes beyond technical things, although I have my moments of introversion, I consider myself someone with a lot of connection and understanding for others.</p>
            
            <p>I have always had a great connection with machines and computers, in particular, I would say that in 2014 was when I began to get very into programming hand in hand with games like Minecraft and SAMP (GTA Multiplayer) creating servers and programming things. I still remember a lot that around that time I began to create things in Minecraft like that from a command (huge) a house would appear and things like that, I made a lot of videos with things like that and had about 10,000 views in each YouTube video.</p>
            
            <p>3 years ago, in 2017 I received a Front-end Architect certificate at <a href="https://www.platzi.com" target="_blank">https://www.platzi.com</a> and this is the only certificate I have because I have developed myself by watching other people's code, programming and learning on my own.</p>
            
            <p>I am self-taught and I am very proud of it because I learn at the same time as I do and I really enjoy doing things, my brain is very wild in that sense. I think doing things like this has allowed me to shape my thinking and learn things that can only be learned by doing and doing.</p>
