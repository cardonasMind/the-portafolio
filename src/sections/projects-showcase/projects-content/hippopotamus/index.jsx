                <p>Hippopotamus is the given name of a <b>Real-time chat </b>made with socketio.</p>

                <div className="paragraph">
                    <p>The first thing you see when entering is the access page which allows you to set your username and the channel you want join to.</p>
                    <p>This channel name is used for other people to enter in, like a facebook group!</p>
                    <p>As simple and perfect as that.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The inputs are case sensitive and of course, every human in a channel has a unique username.</p>

                <h2>The chat itself</h2>

                <p>The chat uses socketio to make this purpose. The back-end is deployed on Heroku at: <a href="https://hippopotamus-server.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://hippopotamus-server.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

                <p>As you can see it has emojis which were easly implemented using React-emoji and also you can see who is in your channel</p>
