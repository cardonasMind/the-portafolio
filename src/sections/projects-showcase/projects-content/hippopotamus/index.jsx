		<p>Hippopotamus is the given name of a <b>Real-time chat </b>made with socketio.</p>

		<div>
			<p>The first thing you see when entering is the access page which allows you to set your username and the channel you want join to.</p>
			<p>This channel name is used for other people to enter in, like a facebook group!</p>
			<p>As simple and perfect as that.</p>
		</div>

		<p>The inputs are case sensitive and of course, every human in a channel has a unique username.</p>
